# Password Generator Starter Code

### Overview

This challenge is designed to test your ability to create a simple yet secure random password generator using JavaScript. The generator should allow users to customize the length and types of characters in their password.


### Here's a summary of what the code does:

User Input: The function prompts the user to input the desired password length and confirms the types of characters to include in the password.

Input Validation: It validates the entered password length to ensure it is a number within the specified range and that at least one character type is selected.

Character Set Creation: It creates a string (allChars) containing all the selected character types based on user input.

Password Generation: It generates the random password by selecting characters from allChars in a loop according to the specified length.

Alert: It displays the generated password in an alert.

 Users can interact with this code by clicking a button (not provided in the code) to trigger the generatePassword function, prompting them for input and displaying the generated password.
